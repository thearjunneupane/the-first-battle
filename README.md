# the-first-battle
A mystical journey of numerical divination, woven in the obscure script of bash.
# Embark on a journey through the unknown, into the heart of Terminal's realm
* Clone the mystical repository with this incantation: ```git clone https://github.com/thearjnep/the-first-battle.git```
* Enter the fabled land of "the-first-battle" with ```cd the-first-battle```
* Conjure the script to life with ```chmod +x thefirstbattle.sh```
* And summon forth the battle with ```./thefirstbattle.sh```
# Gratitude owed!!
